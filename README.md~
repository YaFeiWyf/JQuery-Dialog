This is mine firse plugin which is based on jQuery.
	This plugin include some functions,you can create a dialog by $.dialog(),and use center() function to make your element layout center in your screen.


Now , i would like to introduce how to use $.dialog():


first, if you want to use a default dialog ,you don't have to add any arguments for this function;
second ,if you want to custom some text or html in the dialog ,you can do like this:
	$.dialog({
		cls : ['class1','class2'],  //with this array you can custom some class for this dialog ,then you can modify the dialog's style by these class;
		text : "Here is your custom text",   //you can custom some text for your dialog ,such as "This is my first dialog. Haha!!"
		html : '',     //in this part you can use a template or you can use a DOM object which is already exist in your html document. such as "html : $('#dialog')";
		model : true,   //with this argument ,you can decide if you want a model when the dialog alert. The default set is true.
		btns : [{
				text : '确定',
				cls : 'confirm',
				callback : function(){}
			},{
				text : '取消',
				cls : 'cancel',
				callback : function(){}
			}]					//btns ,you need add an array for this argument, you can custom a button or two buttons for your dialog,
								//this array include one or two object, with this object ,you can custom the button's text ,cls and callback function.
		
	});
third, if you want to make your element layout center in your screen ,you can use center() function, like this: $("#element").center() .So amazing, you can make element center just like this.
